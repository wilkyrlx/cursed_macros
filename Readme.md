# Cursed Macros
This code replaces your functioning c program with a (still functioning) empty file. Or is it...

## Roadmap
- makefile: move c++ file contents to another c++ file
- makefile: edit c++ file contents on move
- makefile: creater header file, add line to new c++ file
- split c++ into parts, adding spaces wherever possible
- convert regex "words" to unique strings of one character
- create header for each unique string
